# Tourlane contentful

## Introduction

The purpose of this exercise is to be able for the next 45 minutes to work together with you over building something.

## Problem background

Contentful is a CMS service that enables non-developers to write content, which we later can fetch through their [API](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/references/content-delivery-api/#/introduction) and list it on our web services.


Contentful like other CMSs provides you with your space where you can define your own content types then add different entries fitted within this content types.

In our space, you can check here [all content types we have defined](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/yrgv2ullbzlt/content_types), You can also check [the interface for checking our entries](https://app.contentful.com/spaces/yrgv2ullbzlt/entries?id=xZwHcHqB1J8vfl7E&contentTypeHidden=false&order.fieldId=updatedAt&order.direction=descending&displayedFieldIds=updatedAt&displayedFieldIds=author) as well.

## Problem

* You can use the bootstrapped rails application provided here, or start a new application from scratch if you prefer.
* Deliver as much as you can of the following scenarios
    - An index page that shows a list of titles of only published post entries from our space
    - Each published post title is a clickable link that leads to a show page that shows the title and body of this post
* We expect tests, Try to demonstrate production quality but of course use workarounds to cut down time just make sure to loudly point out how you would do it differently in production.
